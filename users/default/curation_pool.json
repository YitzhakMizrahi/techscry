The team is working on filtering out this noise to focus more on the user. They are also exploring ways to make the model understand when the user has finished speaking or is pausing to think for a more natural conversation flow. Tips are provided for iPhone users to improve voice isolation and control model responses, with similar features coming soon for Android. Feedback is encouraged as it may lead to new app features in the future.",
