Sano uses illustrations with two-dimensional embeddings to demonstrate how altering the positions of words in a sentence can help differentiate between different sentence structures. He then delves into using concepts of sine and cosine functions to represent positional encoding in higher-dimensional embeddings. Sano provides formulas for positional encoding, explaining how they are applied based on the position of the word and the dimensions of the embedding. He emphasizes the importance of establishing a consistent sequence for modifying words to aid the computer in learning the correct order. Lastly, Sano encourages viewers to subscribe, like, share, and support his content, including mentioning his book on machine learning and inviting viewers to engage further through memberships and Patreon.",

    "summary": "Louis Sano introduces Kogoro Arnold networks, a unique neural network architecture focusing on training activation functions rather than weights, inspired by the Korov Arnold theorem. The networks use B splines to approximate functions, with constant, linear, and quadratic options available. The structure involves spline-connected nodes with trainable \"knot vectors.\" The Korov Arnold representation theorem highlights the efficiency of a two-layer Kogoro Arnold network. Louis Sano encourages engagement and mentions additional content, such as courses and a book \"Rocking Machine Learning,\" with a discount code.",

The team is working on filtering out this noise to focus more on the user. They are also exploring ways to make the model understand when the user has finished speaking or is pausing to think for a more natural conversation flow. Tips are provided for iPhone users to improve voice isolation and control model responses, with similar features coming soon for Android. Feedback is encouraged as it may lead to new app features in the future.",
